express - nodejs web application framework

at its most basic, the web uses a client/server architecture that can be summarized as follows: a client (usually a web browser) sends a request to a server (most of the time a web server like Apache, Nginx, IIS, Tomcat, etc.), using the HTTP protocol. The server answers the request using the same protocol.
